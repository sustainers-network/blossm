#### Sustainer's Network 
###### An implementation of the Blossm base layer that is working towards providing projects built on top access to progressive business model experiments, like [Sustainer's Money](https://github.com/joaoritter/sustainers.money)

For instructions on how to build on top of Sustainer's Network, see the [documentation](https://github.com/blossm-network/toolbox) for Blossm, which explains how to get started and how to connect to a base layer.
